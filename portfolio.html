          <p>This project was a FPGA project coded using SystemVerilog. It required an 8X8 RGB display. The logic behind
          the project was simple. On the RGB the user had three choices (these choices could be selected by using Basys3
          FPGA) , each of which represented a game type. The user could play a normal TicTac Toe, an SOS game or a
          TicTacToe against an AI (computer).</p>
